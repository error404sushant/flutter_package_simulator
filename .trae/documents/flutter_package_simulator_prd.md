# Flutter Package Download Simulator - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A web application that simulates Flutter package download operations, allowing users to repeatedly execute pub get commands with cache clearing for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Helps developers test package download scenarios and simulate network conditions for Flutter package management workflows.
- Target users include Flutter developers, DevOps engineers, and QA testers who need to validate package download behaviors.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
No role distinction required - single user application.

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our Flutter package simulator consists of the following main pages:
1. **Main Dashboard**: input controls, operation status, progress tracking, results display.
2. **Settings Page**: package configuration, simulation parameters, cache settings.
3. **History Page**: operation logs, previous runs, performance metrics.

### 2.3 Page Details

| Page Name | Module Name | Feature description |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Main Dashboard | Input Controls | Enter count number, select target package, start/stop operation buttons |
| Main Dashboard | Progress Tracker | Real-time progress bar, current operation status, elapsed time display |
| Main Dashboard | Operation Display | Live log output, success/failure indicators, operation counter |
| Main Dashboard | Results Summary | Total operations completed, success rate, average time per operation |
| Settings Page | Package Configuration | Select Flutter package name, version specification, dependency options |
| Settings Page | Simulation Parameters | Delay between operations, timeout settings, retry configuration |
| Settings Page | Cache Management | Cache location settings, clear cache options, cache size display |
| History Page | Operation Logs | Detailed logs of previous runs, timestamps, operation details |
| History Page | Performance Metrics | Charts showing operation times, success rates, historical trends |

## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
1. User opens the main dashboard
2. User enters the desired count of operations
3. User selects or configures the target Flutter package
4. User clicks "Start Simulation" button
5. System begins the simulation loop:
   - Execute pub get for the specified package
   - Display progress and status
   - Clear package cache
   - Repeat for the specified count
6. User can monitor real-time progress and logs
7. User can stop the operation at any time
8. System displays final results and statistics
